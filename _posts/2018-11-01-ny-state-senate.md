In the 2018 mid-term elections, _all_ New York State Senate seats are up for grabs. In the **63 state senate seats**, 29 seats are solidly Democrat, one leans Democrat, three leans Republican, six are strong R, and 19 solidly R. With four tossup races, Democrats in New York has a pathway of gaining control of the state senate — if they could defend one seat (9th District).

With a path for Democrats to gain control of both chambers — with a Democratic governor, there's a path of passing the [New York Health Act](https://www.nyhcampaign.org/). The **New York Health Act** — if passed — will provide comprehensive universal health care for all New Yorkers. It [has passed the state assembly five times](http://gothamist.com/2018/08/22/nyc_universal_healthcare.php) including the last four years in a row. However, because of Republicans and renegade Democrats, the bill has been stopped in the state senate as well.

I was interested in showing how close we are to having universal healthcare in New York State. Some times, it's hard to understand the state senate map of New York, but I tried to simplify it using a hex map. It shows districts with huge areas the same size as the more compact senate districts in New York City.

These visualizations are based on City and State's [preview of the 2018 state Senate elections](https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/campaigns-elections/2018-new-york-senate-elections-guide.html){:target='\_blank'} and Ross Barkan's article on the "[Six most important elections outside NYC](http://gothamist.com/2018/11/01/ny_midterm_elections_upstate.php){:target="\_blank"}".

I used `hexbin` to render the hexes, visualization done in `d3`.
